### THE DIFF (The changes to review)
```diff
{{.Diff}}
```

## TASK
Analyze the diff using the provided Architectural Context and your knowledge of {{.Language}} best practices. Focus on:
1. **Logic & Correctness**: Identify bugs, edge cases, and potential runtime errors.
2. **Architecture & Design**: Check for violations of clean code principles, improper abstractions, or tight coupling.
3. **Performance & Scalability**: Identify resource leaks, unnecessary computations, or bottlenecks.
4. **Security**: Look for common vulnerabilities (injection, improper data handling, etc.) relevant to {{.Language}}.
5. **Readability & Standards**: Ensure the code follows the idiomatic conventions of {{.Language}}.
6. **Test Coverage**: specific check for missing tests, especially for edge cases and error conditions.
7. **Dependency Management**: Check for unnecessary or heavy dependencies that could be avoided.

### SEVERITY GUIDELINES
- **Critical**: Security vulnerabilities, data loss risks, or guaranteed crashers in production
- **High**: Logic bugs, incorrect behavior, or breaking changes that affect users
- **Medium**: Performance issues, code smells, or maintainability concerns
- **Low**: Minor improvements or suggestions (only include if highly valuable)

## OUTPUT FORMAT
You must respond ONLY with a valid JSON object inside a ```json code block. No text before or after the JSON block.

The 'comment' field in suggestions MUST be formatted in Markdown and include a 'Rationale' and a 'Fix' example when applicable.

```json
{
  "summary": "Provide a high-level technical assessment. Evaluate the overall health of the PR, the clarity of the logic, and how well it integrates into the existing architecture. End with a clear verdict: Approve, Approve with Suggestions, or Request Changes.",
  "suggestions": [

      "category": "Logic|Performance|Security|Architecture|Readability",
      "comment": "### Issue\nShort description of the problem.\n\n### Rationale\nExplain the technical risk or negative impact of this code. Why should it be changed?\n\n### Fix\nProvide a code snippet showing the corrected implementation.\n```{{.Language}}\n// Corrected code here\n```"
    }
  ]
}
```

If you find no issues, respond with an empty suggestions array and a summary stating the code looks good:
```json
{
  "summary": "The changes are well-structured and follow best practices. No issues found. ✅ Approve.",
  "suggestions": []
}
```
