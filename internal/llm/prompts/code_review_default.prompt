### CORE REVIEW DIMENSIONS

1. **Logic & Correctness**
   - Identify bugs, edge cases, and potential runtime errors
   - **Nil/Zero Value Safety**: Check for nil pointer dereferences, verify empty string/slice/map returns are handled
   - **Error Handling**: 
     - Verify errors are propagated (not stored as string values)
     - Check error paths don't skip required cleanup/state changes
     - Ensure early returns in error paths don't leave data uninitialized
   - **Boundary Conditions**: Test min/max values, empty inputs, concurrent access

2. **Architecture & Design**
   - Check for violations of clean code principles, improper abstractions, or tight coupling
   - **Interface Design**: Verify exported types are minimal and well-documented
   - **Separation of Concerns**: Check for business logic leaking into data/presentation layers
   - **Hidden Dependencies**: Flag unexported helper functions that create untestable coupling

3. **Performance & Scalability**
   - **Resource Leaks**: Unclosed connections, goroutine leaks, unbounded allocations
   - **Context Lifecycle**: CRITICAL - Verify long-running loops check `ctx.Done()` between iterations
   - **Concurrency**: Check goroutines respect context cancellation and proper synchronization
   - **Algorithmic Complexity**: Identify O(n²) or worse patterns that could be optimized

4. **Security**
   - **Input Validation**: ALL user/external inputs must be sanitized:
     - File paths: check for `..`, `/`, `\`, null bytes, path traversal
     - Regex: check for ReDoS vulnerabilities
     - String operations: check for buffer overflows or injection
   - **Path Traversal**: Verify `filepath.Join()` / `path.join()` results stay within intended directory
   - **Sensitive Data**: Ensure credentials/secrets aren't logged, returned in errors, or exposed

5. **Readability & Standards**
   - Follow idiomatic {{.Language}} conventions
   - **Anti-Patterns** ({{.Language}}-specific):
     - Go: pointer to map/slice/channel, mutex in value receiver, missing context checks
     - Python: mutable default arguments, bare except clauses
     - JavaScript: async without await, promise without catch

6. **Test Coverage**
   - Check for missing tests, especially for:
     - Edge cases (empty input, max values, nil values)
     - Error conditions (network failures, context cancellation)
     - Concurrent access patterns
     - Path traversal prevention

7. **Data Flow Analysis**
   - **Trace function parameters through ALL execution paths**
   - Verify pointer/reference parameters are initialized on error paths
   - Check for functions returning empty values without error indication
   - Ensure state changes happen atomically or are properly rolled back on failure

8. **Dependency Management**
   - Unnecessary or heavy dependencies
   - Transitive dependency vulnerabilities
   - License compatibility

9. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Breaking changes to public APIs
   - Changed behavior in existing features
   - Migration path for deprecated features

### VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS (Self-Check)
- **Context Check**: Do NOT flag issues in code that is not visible in the diff unless logical inference is certain. Missing variable definitions or imports are likely just outside the diff context.
- **Validation**: Ensure suggested fixes are syntactically correct and don't introduce new bugs (e.g., race conditions).
- **Tone**: Be constructive. Distinguish between BLOCKING errors (bugs/security) and NON-BLOCKING suggestions (style/perf).

### SEVERITY GUIDELINES
- **Critical**: Security vulnerabilities, data loss/corruption, guaranteed crashes, path traversal, injection flaws
- **High**: Logic bugs, incorrect behavior, breaking changes, resource leaks, missing error handling
- **Medium**: Performance issues, code smells, maintainability concerns, anti-patterns
- **Low**: Minor improvements, style suggestions (ONLY include if highly valuable)
