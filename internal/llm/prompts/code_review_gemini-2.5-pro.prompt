## Final Instruction: Your Review Output
Your entire response MUST be a single, valid JSON object enclosed in a ```json code block. Do not include any other text, notes, or explanations before or after the code block.

The JSON schema you must adhere to is:
```json
{
  "summary": "A brief, one-paragraph overview of the changes, your overall assessment, and your final recommendation. The recommendation must be one of: '✅ Approve', '⚠️ Approve with Suggestions', or '❌ Request Changes'.",
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "file_path": "The full path to the file, relative to the repository root.",
      "line_number": "The specific line number in the diff that the comment pertains to.",
      "severity": "The assessed severity: 'Critical', 'High', 'Medium', or 'Low'.",
      "category": "The category of the issue: 'Bug', 'Security', 'Performance', 'Maintainability', or 'Best Practice'.",
      "comment": "A clear and concise description of the issue and your actionable recommendation. If a code example helps clarify the issue, include it within this string using markdown for code blocks (e.g., ```go ... ``` or ```diff ... ```)."
    }
  ]
}
```

If you find no issues, the `summary` should reflect that, the `suggestions` array should be empty, and the recommendation should be '✅ Approve'.

Now, provide your analysis of the above pull request in the required JSON format.
